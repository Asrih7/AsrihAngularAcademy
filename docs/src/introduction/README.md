# Introduction

**Angular** is a popular open-source framework by Google for building single-page and dynamic web applications. It offers tools and libraries for components, services, forms, routing, and HTTP client, all built with TypeScript. Angular is known for its performance, scalability, and developer productivity.

### Features of Angular

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable, self-contained units of code that define the UI and behavior of a part of the application.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view.
- **Dependency Injection**: Provides components with the services they need for better modularity and testability.
- **Routing**: Powerful system for navigation between different views, supporting deep linking, lazy loading, and route guards.
- **Forms**: Tools for template-driven and reactive forms, based on a model-driven approach.
- **HTTP Client**: Simple API for making HTTP requests and handling responses.
- **Observables**: Handles asynchronous operations and event handling.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript with static typing, better tooling, error checking, and code completion.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with virtual DOM, lazy loading, tree shaking, and ahead-of-time compilation.
- **Mobile Support**: Tools for building responsive, touch-friendly mobile applications, including PWAs.
- **SEO Friendly**: Tools for server-side rendering, pre-rendering, and meta tags to improve search engine visibility.
- **Community Support**: Large, active community providing support and sharing knowledge.

### Difference between AngularJS vs Angular

| AngularJS | Angular |
|-----|-----|
|Based on MVC Architecture|Based on Components|
|Uses JavaScript to build the application| Uses TypeScript to build the application|
|No Mobile Support|Mobile supports|
|Run on only client-side|Runs on both client-side as well as server-side|
|CLI not present|CLI present|
|No SEO Friendly|Seo Friendly|
|Performance is slow|Performance is fast|



### Angular vs React

- **Angular**: A full-fledged framework by Google for building web applications. It includes features like two-way data binding, routing, forms, and HTTP client. Ideal for large, complex applications needing a complete solution.

- **React**: A JavaScript library by Facebook focused on building user interfaces. It provides a simple, declarative way to build UI components. Suitable for small to medium-sized applications requiring flexibility and customization.

**Comparison**: Angular offers a complete solution with built-in features, while React focuses on the view layer, allowing developers to choose additional tools and libraries.

**When to use Angular**: Best for large, complex applications needing integrated tools and scalability.

**When to use React**: Best for small to medium-sized applications needing flexibility and a focus on the UI.
