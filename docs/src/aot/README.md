# AOT

**Ahead-of-Time** (AOT) is a type of compilation that compiles your app at build time. This mode is used to pre-compile your Angular application before deployment.

### Advantages of AOT

- Faster startup times as the browser only needs to execute the compiled code.
- Improved performance due to optimized and pre-compiled templates.
- Better security as the templates are already compiled and validated before deployment.
- Smaller bundle sizes since the templates are not included.
