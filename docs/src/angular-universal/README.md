# Angular Universal

Angular Universal is a server-side rendering (SSR) solution for Angular applications that allows you to render your application on the server and send the fully rendered HTML to the client. This can improve performance, SEO, and user experience by reducing the time to first contentful paint and enabling search engines to crawl and index your application.

### Creating an Angular Universal application

To create an Angular Universal application, you can use the Angular CLI to generate a new project with the Universal schematic.

```bash
ng new --ssr
```

To add Angular Universal to an existing Angular application, you can use the Angular CLI to add the Universal schematic to the project.

```bash
ng add @angular/ssr
```
